Detectability tools

This will be the repository with all the tools for the VHE detection project.

Last summer, I used some code from Jeremy and designed my own code to develop a tool 
that predicts the detectability of GRBs in ground-based VHE instruments.

This summer I plan to redesign Jeremy's portion to the code to be more specific to my tasks.
I also plan on working on a scripted LAT analysis tool that will provide the necessary information for this tool.
